**CoEdited by Yuuki#0802**

[click here to go back to the main guide](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/BMBFCustomSabers/blob/master/README.md)



you'll have to start by making an account here:

https://sidequestvr.com/#/account

then go here:

drag BMBFmod.json over here, and add an image (Quest screenshot or cover image work fine)

everything should be filled in automagically

Make sure you have the mods category selected, and add your download link in link url (doesn't have to be github, but I'll show you how to get it from github in the next step), you can also add all your social medias to the mod as well in here, just select the appropriate category in the list, but for the mod download link you want to have BMBFmod

to get the mod download link, just go to github, go to your mod zip and right click download and select "copy address location", This should also work for any other file hosting place, as long as you copy the download button's address link so if you were to click that link it'll download instantly without going to the website

I always add these three URLS

now add tags by typing a tag and then hitting enter to confirm the tag

at the end, just hit save app and it should display "pending" and you'll have to wait for a staff member to approve the mod

you can still edit the mod after it's been saved, except for the package name

when it's up you even get cool stats and stuff

at the bottom is a share URL, if you click refresh and then copy you get a url that shows the mod info in the embed
